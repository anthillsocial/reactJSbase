# Base React.js development environment
The following website provided some great "getting started" instructions for 
setting up a basic development environment. 
https://www.codementor.io/reactjs/tutorial/beginner-guide-setup-reactjs-environment-npm-babel-6-webpack

This repository is the result of those instructions. To get going just:

    # Clone this repository 
    $ git clone

    # Automatically 'live' compile to react app
    $ npm run dev

    # Compile for production: 
    $ npm run build

    # Edit the react application at 
    vim src/client/app/index.jsx

    # View the compiled output in a browser via
    firefox src/client/index.html
